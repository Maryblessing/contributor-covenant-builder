<h1>Resources for Community Moderators</h1>

<p>
  It's important to understand that simply adopting Contributor Covenant will not prevent conflict or toxicity in your community.
</p>

<p>
  You are responsible for the safe, fair, and transparent enforcement of your community's code of conduct. A code of conduct without such enforcement sends a false signal that a community is welcoming and inclusive, which can have a disastrous impact on marginalized or otherwise vulnerable people. Before adopting Contributor Covenant, take the time to discuss enforcement with leaders and other members of your community.
</p>

<p>
  These resources may be helpful in preparing for enforcement discussions:
