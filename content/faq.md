# Frequently Asked Questions

## Does Contributor Covenant prohibit discrimination based on factors that aren't explicitly listed?
Yes. Contributor Covenant explicitly lists protected classes for many reasons, such as reminding people to give them appropriate consideration, and assuring people in those protected classes that they are welcome. However, this is not an invitation to discriminate against others or make people feel unwelcome based on criteria not listed here.


## Is a code of conduct simply a way to promote a particular political or ideological agenda?
“Everything is politics”, but a code of conduct is not about the advancement of leftist politics. It’s about establishing a minimal baseline of civil and professional collaboration. Non-discriminatory behavior should be a shared value held by people of all ideologies, regardless of political affiliation.

## Why should my community have to change to accommodate marginalized people?
The level of accommodation that the code of conduct implies is not higher than the one that is expected when dealing with peers in other professional settings. It is not about being accommodating to one group, it’s about making all participants feel welcome and safe.

## Does adopting a code of conduct mean that someone can be kicked out of a community for a simple mistake, holding an unpopular belief, or sharing an opinion on social media?
Contributor Covenant specifically states that behavior, actions, and communications outside the scope of the community cannot be considered violations of the code of conduct, unless the person in question is representing the community in an official capacity.

In the case of a confirmed violation, Community Moderators are expected to respond to a violation with a consequence that is proportional to the offense and to work with the offender to prevent future violations. Everyone wants a safe, collaborative community of bright, kind, compassionate people of all kinds.

## Does a code of conduct give too much power to community leaders?
If you have concerns about whether community leaders will enforce the code of conduct fairly, it may be worth reconsidering your participation in that community.

## What should I do if I have been accused of violating a code of conduct?
The first step when dealing with accusations of violation of a code of conduct is to deal with it in a professional manner. Do not respond with sarcasm, attack the code of conduct or its enforcement, or the accuser. Calmly focus on the evidence of what happened, work to understand any damage you may have caused, and examine how your intentions may have inadvertently caused harm. The more you stick to the facts of what happened, and demonstrate your willingness to work with Community Moderators as they evaluate the claim, the better. Most importantly, trust the project maintainers to act in a fair and just manner.

## Why are ’ethnicity’ and ‘race’ called out as two separate characteristics?
_Ethnicity_ (or ethnic group) is a category of people who identify with each other based on similarities such as common ancestry, language, history, society, culture or nation.

_Race_ is the grouping of humans based on shared physical or social qualities into categories generally viewed as distinct by society and usually resulting from genetic ancestry.

We recognize different cultures and the process of translation might make the differences between these terms less apparent. Violence and discrimination can occur based on the perception of either and sometimes both at the same time, which is why it is important to call them out as two separate concepts.

## Why are ‘gender’ and ‘sex characteristics’ listed as separate characteristics?
