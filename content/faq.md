# Frequently Asked Questions

## Is Contributor Covenant just for open source communities?

Contributor Covenant was originally written for open source communities, but in the decade since its creation it has been adopted by online and offline communities, events, and organizations of all kinds– from Discord servers to garden clubs, tech conferences to artist collectives. We designed Contributor Covenant 3 to be even more flexible in the types of communities that it serves.

## Contributor Covenant includes information on enforcement. If my community or organization has its own enforcement policies, can we still adopt Contributor Covenant?

Yes! The enforcement ladder introduced in Contributor Covenant 2.x and revised in 3.x is intended as a guideline based on best practices, not as a prescribed set of enforcement policies. Communities are encouraged to customize the "Addressing and Repairing Harm" section to clearly and accurately reflect their own policies and procedures, including linking to more detailed documentation as appropriate.

## Does a code of conduct give too much power to community leaders?
The philosophy behind Contributor Covenant is that everyone benefits when the implicit is made explicit. A code of conduct does not give community leaders any power that they did not already have, but creates accountability for how that power is used in service of the greater community.

## Why are ’ethnicity’ and ‘race’ called out as separate characteristics? 

Ethnicity (or ethnic group) is a category of people who identify with each other based on similarities such as common ancestry, language, history, society, culture or nation.

Race is the grouping of humans based on shared physical or social qualities into categories generally viewed as distinct by society and usually resulting from genetic ancestry.

We recognize that different cultures and the process of translation might make the differences between these terms less apparent. Violence and discrimination can occur based on the perception of either and sometimes both at the same time, which is why it is important to call them out as two separate concepts.

## Why are 'sex' and 'gender' listed separately?

Sex characteristics are biologically determined, and may or may not align with a person’s gender, which is socially determined.  For example, a woman born without a uterus still deserves protection.  A man who is unable to grow facial hair doesn’t deserve to be teased. 

When we are born, often a doctor assigns us a sex. This has to do with our biology, chromosomes, and physical body. Babies are generally labeled as boys or girls. But even sex is more complex than that — and it really exists on a spectrum. Intersex individuals have physical sex traits or reproductive anatomy that are present at birth or emerge spontaneously later in life, and differ from normative expectations of “male” and “female.”

Some people never question their assigned gender or sex, and choose to identify with what they were assigned at birth — that’s called being “cisgender.” But there are others who do question their gender or sex, choosing to transition or recognize their reality with a different gender than the one they were assigned at birth, and that status is also protected in our community under our code of conduct.

## Does Contributor Covenant prohibit discrimination based on factors that aren't explicitly listed?

Contributor Covenant explicitly lists protected classes for many reasons, such as reminding people to give them appropriate consideration, and assuring people in those protected classes that they are welcome. However, this is not an invitation to discriminate against others or make people feel unwelcome based on criteria not listed here.


## Can someone be kicked out of a community for a simple mistake, holding an unpopular belief, or sharing an opinion on social media?

Contributor Covenant specifically states that behavior, actions, and communications outside the scope of the community cannot be considered violations of the code of conduct, unless the person in question is representing the community in an official capacity. However, the public behavior of an individual outside of community spaces may impact those within community spaces as well. 

Communities are encouraged to explore additional policies to ensure the safety and well-being of their members beyond code of conduct violations.

## What should I do if I have been accused of violating a code of conduct?

The first step when dealing with accusations of violation of a code of conduct is to respond in a professional manner. Do not respond with sarcasm, attack the code of conduct, or criticize the accuser. Calmly focus on the evidence of what happened, work to understand any harm you may have caused, and examine how that harm can be repaired. Stick to the facts of what happened, and demonstrate your willingness to work with Community Moderators as they evaluate the report. If you disagree with their decision, you may ask about what sort of appeal process is available to you.

In all enforcement matters, Community Moderators are expected to respond to a violation with a consequence that is proportional to the offense and to work with the offender to prevent future violations. Everyone wants a safe, collaborative community of bright, kind, compassionate people of all kinds. 

## Is a code of conduct simply a way to promote a particular political or ideological agenda?

A code of conduct is not about the advancement of a particular political agenda. It’s about establishing a minimal baseline of civil and professional collaboration.

## Why should my community have to change to accommodate marginalized people?

The level of accommodation that the code of conduct implies is not higher than the one that is expected when dealing with peers in other professional settings. It is not about being accommodating to one group, it’s about making all participants feel welcome and safe.

## Who wrote Contributor Covenant?

## Who is responsible for maintaining Contributor Covenant?
