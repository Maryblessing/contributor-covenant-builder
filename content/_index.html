  <h2>
    Philosophy & Purpose
  </h2>

  <p>
    A healthy community is sustained by its shared values. While every community is different, there are fundamental principles and norms that are essential to fostering a culture of belonging and inclusion. Since its inception in 2014, Contributor Covenant has always upheld the belief that everyone benefits when our implicit values are made explicit.
